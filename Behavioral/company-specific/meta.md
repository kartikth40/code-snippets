- Risk: Big migration, could break existing clients
- Created migration plan:
  - Week 1: GraphQL server alongside REST (both work)
  - Week 2: Migrate 10% of endpoints
  - Week 3-4: Migrate 50%
  - Week 5-6: Migrate 100%, deprecate REST
- Built migration tooling (automated much of the work)
- Communicated timeline to all teams
R:
📊 API response size: 200KB → 50KB (75% reduction)
📊 Mobile app load time: 2s → 0.8s

## ⚠️ Meta-Specific Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do:
- **Emphasize metrics** - Every answer should have numbers
- **Show scale** - Millions of users, billions of requests
- **Demonstrate speed** - Shipped in days/weeks, not months
- **Talk about A/B tests** - Meta loves experimentation
- **Mention impact** - "This increased revenue by..." or "This helped X users"
- **Show iteration** - V1, V2, V3 mindset
- **Be bold** - Talk about big risks, big bets
- **Admit failures** - Especially if you learned and moved fast

### ❌ Don't:
- Focus only on perfection (Meta values done > perfect)
- Talk about small-scale projects (unless impactful)
- Avoid metrics (quantify everything!)
- Be afraid to fail (failure is learning at Meta)
- Say "It took 6 months to plan" (too slow)
- Skip iteration (jumping to perfect solution)
