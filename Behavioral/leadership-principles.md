## 📋 The 14 Principles

### 1. **Customer Obsession**

**Principle:**  
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

**Interview Question Examples:**
- "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer"
- "Describe a time you had to make a trade-off between customer experience and business metrics"
- "Tell me about a time customer feedback changed your approach"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Putting customer needs first, even if inconvenient
- Using customer feedback to drive decisions
- Measuring success by customer satisfaction

**Example Story Hook:**
*"When analyzing user data, I discovered 15% of users were abandoning checkout due to a confusing UX. I advocated for redesigning the flow despite it delaying another feature..."*

---

### 2. **Ownership**

**Principle:**  
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you took on something outside your area of responsibility"
- "Describe a time you had to make a decision without approval"
- "Tell me about a time you had to think long-term over short-term gains"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Taking initiative beyond job description
- Thinking company-wide, not just your team
- Long-term thinking

**Example Story Hook:**
*"Even though it wasn't my responsibility, I noticed our deployments were failing 30% of the time. I volunteered to fix the CI/CD pipeline..."*

---

### 3. **Invent and Simplify**

**Principle:**  
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here."

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you innovated to solve a problem"
- "Describe a time you simplified a complex process"
- "Tell me about a time you came up with a creative solution"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Finding simpler solutions to complex problems
- Innovation and thinking outside the box
- Borrowing ideas from other domains

**Example Story Hook:**
*"Our service had 15 microservices and deployments took 3 hours. I proposed consolidating to 3 services, which the team resisted, but I prototyped it and reduced deployment to 20 minutes..."*

---

### 4. **Are Right, A Lot**

**Principle:**  
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you were wrong"
- "Describe a time you changed your mind based on new data"
- "Tell me about a time you made a decision with incomplete information"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Good judgment and decision-making
- Humility (admitting when wrong)
- Data-driven decisions

**Example Story Hook:**
*"I initially chose NoSQL for our database, but after load testing, the data showed SQL was actually better for our use case. I admitted my mistake and switched..."*

---

### 5. **Learn and Be Curious**

**Principle:**  
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you learned a new skill quickly"
- "Describe a time you went beyond your comfort zone"
- "Tell me about a recent technology you learned"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Continuous learning and growth mindset
- Curiosity and exploration
- Learning from failures

**Example Story Hook:**
*"I had never used Kubernetes, but our team needed to migrate. I spent weekends learning, got certified, and led the migration..."*

---

### 6. **Hire and Develop the Best**

**Principle:**  
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you mentored someone"
- "Describe a time you helped someone grow in their role"
- "Tell me about a tough hiring decision you made"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Raising the bar (not compromising on talent)
- Mentoring and developing others
- Recognizing and nurturing talent

**Example Story Hook:**
*"I mentored a junior engineer who was struggling with algorithms. I created a weekly study plan, and within 3 months they were contributing complex features..."*

---

### 7. **Insist on the Highest Standards**

**Principle:**  
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you refused to compromise on quality"
- "Describe a time you pushed back on a deadline to maintain standards"
- "Tell me about a time you identified and fixed a quality issue"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Not settling for "good enough"
- Quality over speed (when appropriate)
- Attention to detail

**Example Story Hook:**
*"During code review, I found a security vulnerability in a feature. Even though we were 1 day from launch, I insisted we fix it, delaying the release by a week..."*

---

### 8. **Think Big**

**Principle:**  
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you proposed a bold idea"
- "Describe a time you thought beyond your immediate task"
- "Tell me about a time you identified a long-term opportunity"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Visionary thinking
- Long-term strategy
- Ambitious goals

**Example Story Hook:**
*"Instead of just fixing bugs in our legacy system, I proposed rebuilding it from scratch with modern architecture. Leadership approved, and we completed it in 9 months..."*

---

### 9. **Bias for Action**

**Principle:**  
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you made a decision with incomplete information"
- "Describe a time you took a calculated risk"
- "Tell me about a time you had to move fast"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Moving quickly on decisions
- Calculated risk-taking
- Not over-analyzing

**Example Story Hook:**
*"We had a production outage and limited debugging info. Instead of waiting for full logs, I reverted the last 3 deployments immediately, which restored service in 10 minutes..."*

---

### 10. **Frugality**

**Principle:**  
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you delivered results with limited resources"
- "Describe a time you saved costs"
- "Tell me about a time you found a scrappy solution"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Doing more with less
- Cost consciousness
- Creative resource usage

**Example Story Hook:**
*"Our team requested 10 new servers ($50K/year). Instead, I optimized our queries and caching, which reduced load by 60% using existing infrastructure..."*

---

### 11. **Earn Trust**

**Principle:**  
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you admitted a mistake"
- "Describe a time you built trust with a skeptical stakeholder"
- "Tell me about a time you gave difficult feedback"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Transparency and honesty
- Admitting mistakes
- Building relationships through trust

**Example Story Hook:**
*"I made a critical error that cost 2 hours of downtime. Instead of hiding it, I immediately told my manager, wrote a blameless postmortem, and implemented safeguards..."*

---

### 12. **Dive Deep**

**Principle:**  
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdotes differ.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you dug deep to find the root cause"
- "Describe a time you uncovered a hidden problem"
- "Tell me about a time you challenged a metric"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Attention to detail
- Not just trusting high-level metrics
- Getting hands-on when needed

**Example Story Hook:**
*"Our dashboard showed 99.9% API success rate, but users complained about errors. I dove into logs and found we weren't counting timeout errors, which were 5% of requests..."*

---

### 13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**

**Principle:**  
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"
- "Describe a time you challenged a decision"
- "Tell me about a time you had to commit to a decision you disagreed with"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Respectfully challenging decisions
- Backing up disagreement with data
- Committing fully once decision is made

**Example Story Hook:**
*"My manager wanted to use MongoDB, but I believed PostgreSQL was better for our use case. I presented data, we debated, they decided MongoDB. I committed fully and made it work..."*

---

### 14. **Deliver Results**

**Principle:**  
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

**Interview Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you delivered despite obstacles"
- "Describe a time you missed a deadline and how you handled it"
- "Tell me about your most significant accomplishment"

**What They're Looking For:**
- Focus on outcomes, not inputs
- Overcoming obstacles
- Delivering quality on time

**Example Story Hook:**
*"Despite losing 2 team members mid-sprint and a vendor API breaking, I re-scoped the project, worked weekends, and delivered the critical path features on time..."*
