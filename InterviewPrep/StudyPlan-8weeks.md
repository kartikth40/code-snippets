## 💡 Study Tips

### Do's:
✅ **Solve problems without looking at solutions** (try 30-45 min first)  
✅ **Practice explaining solutions out loud** (simulate interview)  
✅ **Review mistakes immediately** (understand why you got stuck)  
✅ **Code on whiteboard/paper** (harder than IDE)  
✅ **Time yourself** (build speed and pressure tolerance)  
✅ **Focus on patterns, not memorization** (understand the "why")  
✅ **Take breaks** (Pomodoro: 50 min work, 10 min rest)  

### Don'ts:
❌ **Don't just read solutions** (you won't learn the problem-solving process)  
❌ **Don't spend >1 hour stuck** (diminishing returns, move on)  
❌ **Don't skip the "easy" problems** (they build confidence)  
❌ **Don't cram the night before** (rest is more important)  
❌ **Don't compare yourself to others** (everyone's timeline is different)  
❌ **Don't skip mock interviews** (they're the best practice)
