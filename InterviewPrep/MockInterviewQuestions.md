## 📊 How to Use This Guide

### **Week 8 Mock Interview Schedule:**
- **Days 1-2**: Easy/Medium questions (warm-up)
- **Days 3-5**: Medium/Hard questions (peak difficulty)
- **Days 6-7**: Company-specific mocks (simulate real interviews)

### **Format:**
Each mock interview should last 45-60 minutes:
- 5 min: Introduction, clarifying questions
- 35-40 min: Problem solving (think aloud!)
- 10-15 min: Questions for interviewer, wrap-up

### **Grading Yourself:**
After each mock, evaluate:
- ✅ **Problem Understanding** (asked clarifying questions?)
- ✅ **Approach** (discussed multiple approaches?)
- ✅ **Code Quality** (clean, readable, idiomatic?)
- ✅ **Testing** (thought about edge cases?)
- ✅ **Communication** (explained thought process?)
- ✅ **Time Management** (finished on time?)

## 🔰 Mock Interview Set 1: Easy/Medium (Warm-up)

**Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Target:** Get comfortable with interview format

### **Problem 1: Two Sum Variants (15 min)**
```
Given an array of integers and a target, find two numbers that add up to target.

Follow-ups:
1. What if array is sorted? (Two pointers: O(n))
2. What if we need all pairs? (Set-based approach)
3. What if we need to find three numbers (3Sum)? (O(n²))
4. What if duplicates matter?

Test cases:
- [2,7,11,15], target=9 → [0,1]
- [3,2,4], target=6 → [1,2]
- [3,3], target=6 → [0,1]
- [], target=0 → [] (edge case)
```

### **Problem 2: Valid Parentheses (15 min)**
```
Given a string containing just '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']', 
determine if the input string is valid.

Examples:
- "()" → true
- "()[]{}" → true
- "(]" → false
- "([)]" → false
- "{[]}" → true

Follow-ups:
1. What if we need to find minimum additions to make valid?
2. What if we need to remove minimum to make valid?
3. Handle nested depths?
```

### **Problem 3: Merge Two Sorted Lists (15 min)**
```
Merge two sorted linked lists.

Example:
list1 = 1→2→4
list2 = 1→3→4
output = 1→1→2→3→4→4

Follow-ups:
1. Merge K sorted lists (use heap)
2. Merge in-place without extra space
3. What if lists have cycles?
```

## ⚡ Mock Interview Set 2: Medium (Core Patterns)

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Target:** Pattern recognition and optimization

### **Problem 1: LRU Cache (30 min)**
```
Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache.

Operations:
- get(key): Get value (return -1 if not exists), mark as recently used
- put(key, value): Set value, evict LRU if at capacity

Requirements:
- O(1) get
- O(1) put

Example:
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache(2); // capacity = 2
cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)

Follow-ups:
1. Thread safety? (locks, concurrent access)
2. Persistent storage?
3. LFU (Least Frequently Used) instead?
4. TTL (time-to-live) support?

Implementation hint: HashMap + DoublyLinkedList
```

### **Problem 2: Word Break (15 min)**
```
Given string s and dictionary wordDict, return true if s can be 
segmented into space-separated sequence of dictionary words.

Examples:
- s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"] → true
- s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"] → true
- s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"] → false

Follow-ups:
1. Return all possible sentences (DFS + backtracking)
2. Minimum number of words needed?
3. What if dictionary is very large? (Trie)

Pattern: Dynamic Programming
```

## 🔥 Mock Interview Set 3: Medium/Hard (Challenging)

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Target:** Advanced problem-solving

### **Problem 1: Design Twitter (45 min)**
```
Design a simplified version of Twitter with:
1. postTweet(userId, tweetId): Create new tweet
2. getNewsFeed(userId): Retrieve 10 most recent tweets 
   from user and people they follow
3. follow(followerId, followeeId): Follower follows followee
4. unfollow(followerId, followeeId): Follower unfollows followee

Example:
Twitter twitter = new Twitter();
twitter.postTweet(1, 5);
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);   // [5]
twitter.follow(1, 2);
twitter.postTweet(2, 6);
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);   // [6, 5]
twitter.unfollow(1, 2);
twitter.getNewsFeed(1);   // [5]

Follow-ups:
1. Scale to millions of users (sharding, caching)
2. Trending topics
3. Retweets, likes
4. Search functionality

Data structures: HashMap, Heap (for merge K sorted lists)
```

### **Problem 2: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (15 min)**
```
Design algorithm to serialize/deserialize binary tree.

Example:
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

serialize(root) → "1,2,#,#,3,4,#,#,5,#,#"
deserialize(data) → reconstruct tree

Follow-ups:
1. Multiple serialization formats (BFS, DFS, level-order)
2. Optimize for space
3. Handle null nodes efficiently
4. N-ary tree instead

Pattern: Tree traversal (preorder/level-order)
```

## 🎯 Mock Interview Set 4: Hard (Advanced)

**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Target:** Demonstrate expertise

### **Problem 1: Median of Data Stream (20 min)**
```
Design data structure that supports:
1. addNum(int num): Add integer from data stream
2. findMedian(): Return median of all elements so far

Example:
MedianFinder mf = new MedianFinder();
mf.addNum(1);
mf.addNum(2);
mf.findMedian(); // 1.5
mf.addNum(3);
mf.findMedian(); // 2

Follow-ups:
1. Optimize for space
2. Parallel streams
3. 95th percentile instead of median
4. Sliding window median

Solution: Two heaps (max-heap for lower half, min-heap for upper half)
Time: O(log n) add, O(1) median
```

### **Problem 2: Trapping Rain Water (20 min)**
```
Given n non-negative integers representing elevation map 
where width of each bar is 1, compute how much water can trap.

Example:
height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
         ▓       ▓▓▓▓    ▓▓▓▓▓ 
Output: 6

Follow-ups:
1. 2D version (water trapped in 2D grid)
2. Optimize space to O(1)
3. What if heights can be negative?

Approaches:
- Two pointers: O(n) time, O(1) space ⭐
- DP: O(n) time, O(n) space
- Stack: O(n) time, O(n) space
```

### **Problem 3: Regular Expression Matching (20 min)**
```
Implement regex matching with '.' and '*':
- '.' matches any single character
- '*' matches zero or more of preceding element

Examples:
- s = "aa", p = "a" → false
- s = "aa", p = "a*" → true
- s = "ab", p = ".*" → true

Follow-ups:
1. Add '+' (one or more)
2. Add '?' (zero or one)
3. Wildcard matching (different from regex)

Pattern: Dynamic Programming (2D DP)
Time: O(m*n), Space: O(m*n)
```

## 💡 Final Tips

### **Red Flags to Avoid:**
- ❌ Jumping into code without discussing approach
- ❌ Not asking clarifying questions
- ❌ Writing buggy code without testing
- ❌ Giving up when stuck
- ❌ Not thinking aloud (silent coding)
- ❌ Ignoring hints from interviewer
- ❌ Poor communication skills

### **Green Flags (What Interviewers Love):**
- ✅ Ask about constraints (input size, edge cases)
- ✅ Discuss multiple approaches (brute force → optimal)
- ✅ Analyze time/space complexity
- ✅ Write clean, readable code
- ✅ Test code with examples
- ✅ Handle edge cases
- ✅ Communicate thought process clearly
- ✅ Stay calm under pressure

### **If You Get Stuck:**
1. **Talk through the problem** - Explaining helps clarify
2. **Use examples** - Walk through small input
3. **Ask for hints** - "I'm considering X, is that on the right track?"
4. **Start with brute force** - Better than nothing, optimize later
5. **Take a breath** - 10 seconds of silence is OK to think
